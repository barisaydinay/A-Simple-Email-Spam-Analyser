# A-Simple-Email-Spam-Analyser
It aims to practice string processing and string matching. My main task in this project is to develop a simple email spam analyser using C programming language.

Everyone who has ever used an email has experienced spam and phishing emails. Whether itâ€™s an 
an email claiming to be your bank telling you to send your credit card info or The National Lottery telling 
you about your win and how you only need to click the link below to claim your prize.

Interestingly, these spam emails have certain patterns and commonly occurring words that allow for 
quick detection, which is why email clients can sometimes automatically label an email as spam. In this
project, I developed a simple email analyzer to check whether a given pattern is available in a set of non-spam and spam emails.

This application will start by taking the path of a directory in which a bunch of text files are stored. Each text 
file has an email stored in it in the following structure.
--------------------------------
Email_ID
From: Sender
To: Recipient
Date: Day_of_the_month
Type: Spam/Nonspam
Content
--------------------------------


THIS IS A CONSOLE APPLICATION ON CODEBLOCKS!
